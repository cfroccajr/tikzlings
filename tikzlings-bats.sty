%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bat
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic bat can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bat[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bat[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bat[pupil=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bat[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bat[ears=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bat[feet=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The spread of the wings can be adjusted by passing values between 0 and 1 to the \lstinline|wings| option:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bat[wings=0.5]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To turn the bat into a vampire bat, the \lstinline|teeth| option can be used:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bat[teeth=white]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the bat from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bat[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the bat 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bat[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\bat[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}

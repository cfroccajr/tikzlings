%\begin{tcolorbox}[lower separated=false, lefthand width=.8\linewidth]
%\vspace*{0.5cm}

%\end{tcolorbox}
%
%\subsection{Basic Usage}
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\snowman
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%\subsection{Options}
%
%The basic snowman can be modified by changing its colour:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\snowman[body=blue]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%In addition to the colour of the body, the colour of various body parts can be adjusted:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\snowman[eye=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\snowman[nose=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\snowman[mouth=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\snowman[buttons=red]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The biggest enemy of the snowman are raising temperatures:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\snowman[globalwarming,tophat]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%To view the snowman from behind:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\snowman[back]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%The key \lstinline|3D| will make the snowman 3-dimensional:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\snowman[3D]
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%And finally the \lstinline|contour| key will only draw the outlines:
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\snowman[contour=black]
%\end{tcblisting}
